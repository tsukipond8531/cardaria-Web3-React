# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

1. Install [Core](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/core/agoakfejjabomempkjlepdflaleeobhb), a Metamask smart wallet alternative built for Avalanche dApps
2. Turn on the testnet mode by: opening up the Core extension -> click the hamburger menu on the top left -> go to advanced -> turn on the testnet mode
3. Fund your wallet from the [Avax Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/)
